# Ticket Management System

This project is a **Ticket Management System** built with **Flask** and **Bootstrap**. It allows users to manage event tickets by adding ticket numbers, marking entries, filtering tickets by status, and deleting records. The system is designed to be simple and efficient, utilizing a SQLite database for data persistence.

## Features

   - Users can add a new ticket by entering the ticket number.
   
2. **Mark Entry**:
   - Tickets can be marked as "Entered," and the entry time will be recorded.

3. **Filter Tickets**:
   - Tickets can be filtered by:
     - All
     - Entered
     - Not Entered

4. **Search Tickets**:
   - Search for tickets by ticket number.

5. **Delete Tickets**:
   - Remove a ticket from the system.

6. **Reset All Tickets**:
   - Reset all tickets to the "Not Entered" status and clear entry times.

7. **Responsive Design**:
   - Built with Bootstrap 5 for mobile-friendly layouts.
